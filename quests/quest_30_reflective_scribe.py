# Quest 30: The Reflective Scribe
# Concept: Add comments to explain code from previous assignments.

# For this quest, go back to three of your previous quests and add # comments 
# to explain what each part of the code does and why.

# Example comment additions for reference:

# From Quest 2 (The Naming Ceremony):
# hero_name = "Thor"  # Store the hero's name in a variable
# super_power = "Control storms and lightning"  # Store the hero's power
# print("One of the strongest hero from the Avengers is", hero_name, "and his primary power is to", super_power)
# # Print a sentence that combines text with variables

# From Quest 5 (The Echoing Cave):
# player_health = 100  # Initialize the player's health
# player_health = player_health - 25  # Decrease health when attacked
# player_health = player_health + 10  # Increase health when using potion
# # The ability to reassign variables is crucial for games and simulations

# From Quest 9 (The Greedy Goblin):
# gold_pieces = 27  # Total gold to distribute
# friends = 4  # Number of friends
# pieces_per_friend = gold_pieces // friends  # Integer division to get whole pieces
# goblin_keeps = gold_pieces % friends  # Modulo operator gets the remainder
# # The modulo operator is useful for finding remainders and checking even/odd numbers
